# Arcane Branding
A repo for all the branding projects for Arcane Linux. This contains everything that I use to RICE Arcane. I believe that branding is a very important feature when it comes to a Linux "distro". I'm going to basically make my own themes, wallpapers, icons, and sounds for Arcane. So far I've come up with some Ideas.

# Assets
## Themes
1. **Nightwave** - Synthwave inspired theme with cyan and purple accents.
2. **Darkwave** - Synthwave inspirated theme with faded wallpaper, and blkac backgrounds, and purple accents.
3. **Lightwave** - Synthwave inspired theme with standard wallpaper, and pink, cyan, and purple accents. Light theme option.
4. **Galactic** - Purple and Cyan color (Think plaentary duality) with the new JWST photos, and colorized to be purple and cyan.

### Requirements for Themes
All themes must have the following included:
- Custom icons
- Customized WM, and settings
- Customized terminal
- Custom GTK theme
